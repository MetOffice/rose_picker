As we make releases of Rose Picker in the form of environment modules we have
decoupled the project trunk from its users. Thus testing new versions and
adopting them in user projects may be performed in slow time with no need to
synchronise projects.

Having said that it can be useful to test a user project against a new version
of Rose Picker. If you need to do this the easiest way is to load the
development environment as usual, then unload the "rose-picker" module. The
path of the candidate binary directory may then be appended to the PATH
environment variable. Use the "which rose_picker" command to confirm that the
expected version is being used.

This can be done as part of the platform specific optional configuration in a
test suite, should you wish to use that testing vehicle.
